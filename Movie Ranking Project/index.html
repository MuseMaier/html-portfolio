    <p>My dear fellows, let me introduce the best anime I ever saw.<br /> You will become a witness of a young girl whose life is turned upside down because of her parents.<br /> Who will be her friend, who will be her foe, who will be her helper through the challenges?<br /> Interested?<br /> Then do not hesitate and watch this wonderful anime.</p>
    
    <h3>Howl's Moving Castle (2004)</h3>
    <img src="./Moving Castle.jpeg" alt="Moving castle" />
    <p>What I really like about all of Hayao Miyazaki's work is that there is never a guess as to whether the hero is good or bad.<br /> I suggest you watch and make up your own mind.</p>
    
    <h3>My Neghbor Totoro (1988)</h3>
    <img src="./Totoro.jpeg" alt="Totoro and girls sitting on the tree" />
    <p>Whether you like anime or not, this heartwarming story will win your heart!<br /> The story of two sisters moving into the countryside who meet a forest spirit that is named Totoro.<br /> Grab you blanket and pillow, make yourself comfortable, and get ready to dive into a world full of love, frienship and magic. </p>
